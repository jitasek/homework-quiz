# code-quiz

link to the deployed app: https://jitasek.github.io/homework-quiz/

This app is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

My motivation for this work is to practice working with APIs, using timers and practice my DOM manipulation skills.

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question, I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
WHEN the game is over, I can save my initials and my score
